# Retweet prediction

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing is in two steps. Firstly, run "Preprocessing the sentiment". There is a neural network to train based on these [data](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140 ) to train. You need to download it also. You also need the data (train and evaluation). 

Secondly, you need to run the "Preprocessing the data" to preprocess almost everything we need. For that, you will need the two files that were written in the first script "training_v1.npy" and "evaluation_v1.npy". 

## Model training

Run the "Training our model". It will create a file in the *results* folder with the submission.

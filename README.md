The first file to run is the sentiment classifier. It requires the data (train and evaluation) and a twitter data set that you can find there https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140. It will write two new files "training_v1.npy" and "evaluation_v1.npy".
You only need those two files to run the second file : preprocessing.

## Preprocessing

The preprocessing is in two steps. Firstly, run "Preprocessing the sentiment". There is a neural network to train based on these [data](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140 ) to train. You need to download it also. 

Secondly, you need to run the "Preprocessing the data" to preprocess almost everything we need.

## Model training

Run the "Training our model". It will create a file in the *results* folder with the submission.
